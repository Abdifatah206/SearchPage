In this app I used only reactjs and json file to present data in table, there is other 
library installed, I created table with four columns and presented that there, I also added 
detail button to open a form which will present more data, due to small time I have, I didnt 
complete that form, but I have full confident I can do it.



Time:
I started early, but, due to the my online classes which started last week, I got some delay,
but, finally I concluded today 4/20/2020.


Thanks for your time and consideration.
